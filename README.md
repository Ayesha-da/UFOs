# UFOs
## Overview of Project:
To create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.
### Purpose:
To customize webpage using Bootstrap, and equip table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with visualizations. 

## Results:
##### The final result is a visually appealing page where each element meshes well with the next.The users can search for ufos by city or state or country or shape.They can narrow down their searches by applying multiple filters.

##### The users can use the filters to narrow down their search results by applying filters such as what kind of shape of ufo was seen in which city of a state. Here the search result shows the "triangle" shaped ufo was seen in city "el cajon" in state "ca".

## Summary:
### Drawback of this webpage:
Users have to scroll down to see which cities or states or shapes are included in the analysis.If they try to search by a filter that is not included in the data then the search result will not return anything.
### Recommendations:
- Each filter can have drop-down menu, so the users will know they can search results by available options.
