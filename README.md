## Summary
### Drawback of the webpage
- Users have to scroll down to see which cities or states or shapes are included in the analysis.If they try to search by a filter that in not included in the data then the search result will return nothing.
- If multiple filters are applied then users have to clear each filter to start a new search.
### Recommendations
- Each filter can have drop-down menu so the users will know they can search results by available options.
- Clear all button can be added to clear all filters and so the page is ready for new search.
